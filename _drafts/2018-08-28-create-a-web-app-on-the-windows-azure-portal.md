You want to host your ASP.NET Core Web app on Windows Azure and you have no clue where to start? 

This article presents providesa thorough guide on how to use the Azure Portal to create your Web app **Container** that will ultimately host your actual Web app.  

## Prerequisites
In this article I assume you are familiar with Azure App Service (aka Web Apps). If not, I recommend you start first by checking the official documentation for Azure App Service, on the Microsoft Docs website, to get yourself aquatinted with the theoretical knowledge on what is Azure App Service and what it can provide to you as a developer.

To access the Microsoft official documentation on Azure App Service, follow this link: [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)

In addition, you need to have a valid Azure subscription. 

## Azure Portal

Microsoft provides the Azure Portal that plays the role of a Web Interface for all of the features that Azure contains. For this article and the coming ones in this series, I am going to use the **preview** version of the Azure Portal. This preview version was announced back in February 2017 here: [New Azure Preview Portal Grants Eary Access to Features](https://buildazure.com/2017/02/03/new-azure-preview-portal-grants-early-access-to-features/) 

To start with,
 
## Create Web App Container

### Add a Resource Group

### Add an App Service Plan

## Create Staging Deployment Slot

### Set Deployment Credentials

### Set Deployment Source
