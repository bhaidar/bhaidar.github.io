title: GraphQL is the new REST - Part 1
---

The best way to learn GraphQL syntax and concepts is to build your own GraphQL Server API and Client app. I will take you through the process of building a GraphQL Server API on top of Node.js and Express engine. At the same time, I will be using Angular 7 to build a client app to utilize the GraphQL Server API and perform CRUD operations for managing Books and Authors.

In Part 1 of this article, we will build the GraphQL Server API. In Part 2, we will build the GraphQL Angular Client app.
