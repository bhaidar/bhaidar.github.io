title: Hasura, GraphQL Backend in the Cloud - Part 1
---

Join me in the first installment of a three-part series on Hasura GraphQL Engine. We’ll start by learning the basic Hasura concepts. Then, we’ll move on to explore how Hasura extends the standard GraphQL, allowing you to query and mutate the backend database.

Finally, we’ll demonstrate a Vue.js application that authenticates/authorizes with Auth0, which communicates in an instance of Hasura Engine deploying on Heroku to manage food recipes. Yummy!
