title: Nest.js Step by Step - Part 1
---

This article is the first of a series of articles on the Nest framework. The ultimate goal of this series is to introduce you to Nest concepts and provide you with hands-on experience in writing Nest server-side apps so that you can start adopting it in your own projects.

Throughout this series, I’ll be building a full stack app to manage To Do lists. I’ll keep the app simple so that there’s enough time to explore a variety of features available in the framework.

In a nutshell, I’m going to:

- Build a REST API to manage To Do lists and tasks
- Use the PostgreSQL database to store the data
- Authenticate users with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Allow user registration and log in
- Build a front-end Angular app to allow users to create and manage their To Do lists

In this first installment, I’ll start by generating a new Nest.js app and building the REST API based on an in-memory data storage.
