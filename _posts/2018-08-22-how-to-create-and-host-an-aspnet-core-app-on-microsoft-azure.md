Are you new to Microsoft Azure and want a detailed guide on how to host your next ASP.NET Core application there? 

Join me in a new series, that I am hosting on my blog, going through building an ASP.NET Core application using the .NET Core Command Line Interface (CLI). Once the application is created, we shall use the Azure Portal to create a new Web App container to host the application files. Finally, by using Git I will show you how to push your application to Microsoft Azure and have it up and running.

This series will be split into two parts:

1. [Create a Web App on the Microsoft Azure Portal](https://www.bilalhaidar.com/2018/09/create-a-web-app-on-the-microsoft-azure-portal)
2. [Create an ASP.NET Core app with .NET Core CLI and push to Azure using Git](https://www.bilalhaidar.com/2018/09/create-aspnet-core-app-with-dotnet-cli-and-push-to-azure-using-git)

During the course, you will be introduced to Azure and Cloud concepts. For example, the **Deployment Slots** and their powerful design to give you and your client the opportunity to test the upcoming features of the application live in production without affecting the main application or the running and serving users.

This blog post will hold hyperlinks to the two part series. So next time I post a new blog post on this series, be assured that I will be updating this post to add a link to each of the three parts.

Happy Azuring!!
