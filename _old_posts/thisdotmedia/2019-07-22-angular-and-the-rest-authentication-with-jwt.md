title: Angular and the REST - Authentication with JWT
---

In this second installment of the series on Angular and the REST, I implement authentication on the backend ASP.NET Core Web API using JWT (JSON Web Token). In addition, I add a new authentication module on the Angular app side, so access is restricted to authenticated users only by way of a Login.
