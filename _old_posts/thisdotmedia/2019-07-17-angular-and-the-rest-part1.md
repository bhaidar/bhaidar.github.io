title: Angular and the REST - Part 1
---

This week and the coming one, I'll be writing a new series of articles on how to develop a full-stack application with Angular v8 on the client-side backed up with ASP.NET Core 2.2 and Node.js respectively.

The first two installments of this series will cover building an Angular app and connecting it to an ASP.NET Core Web API app. The backend Web API uses SQLite database for storage and also authenticates users by means of JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

The second two installments will look at using the same Angular app, however this time, connecting it to a backend Node.js API app (most likely using Nest.js). The backend API uses a PostgreSQL database for storage and also authenticates users by means of JWT.
